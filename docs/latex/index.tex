{\bfseries Important Interfaces}

The two most important interfaces you will use are the \href{classsc2_1_1_observation_interface.html}{\tt Observation\+Interface} and the \href{classsc2_1_1_action_interface.html}{\tt Action\+Interface} which are available to your \href{classsc2_1_1_agent.html}{\tt Agent}. Get the Observation\+Interface by calling {\bfseries Observation()}, and the Action\+Interface by calling {\bfseries Actions()} from your Agent.

An \char`\"{}\+Agent\char`\"{} is your bot, capable of performing actions in a game -- a player.

An \char`\"{}\+Observation\char`\"{} is a snapshot of the game\textquotesingle{}s state at any given point in time, which is available at any time when a game or replay is running. The Observation Interface provides access to a list of units, including your Bot\textquotesingle{}s units and enemy units that are visible to your units.

An \char`\"{}\+Action\char`\"{} is a command given to units, for example to attack, move or build a structure.

\item Structures are a type of unit, and are included when you call \char`\"{}\+Get\+Units\char`\"{}.
