/*! \file sc2_client.h
    \brief The base class for Agent and ReplayObserver.

The Client and ClientEvents provides most of the functionality a user would be interested in for examining
game state and scripting bots. A user should prefer to inherit from either Agent or ReplayObserver, those classes
both inherit from Client.
