/*! \file sc2_interfaces.h
    \brief A set of public facing interfaces used to query game state.

Each function in this class is pure virtual but is not intended for a user of the API to overwrite.
An implementation file that utilizes this interface will be responsible for its definition and should
be of little concern to the consumer.
