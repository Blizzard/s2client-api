/*! \file sc2_coordinator.h
    \brief Frontend for running a game.

    The coordinator acts as a game and bot manager. It is used to launch StarCraft and setup proto connections
    between a user's bot and the running StarCraft instance. With it a user steps forward a simulation and it will
    fill out bot interface data.

    //!     2. (Recommended) If the StarCraft II binary has been run the function will auto discover its location.
    //! \param argc Provided in main signature.
    //! \param argv Provided in main signature.

    //! * For non-real time Update will perform the following:
    //!     1. Step the simulation forward by a certain amount of game steps, this essentially moves the game loops forward.
    //!     2. Wait for the step to complete, the step is completed when a response is received and read from the StarCraft II binary.
    //!         * When the step is completed an Observation has been received. It is parsed and various client events are dispatched.
    //!     3. Call the user's OnStep function.
    //! * Real time applications will perform the following:
    //!     1. The Observation is directly requested. The process will block while waiting for it.
    //!     2. The Observation is parsed and client events are dispatched.
    //!     3. Unit actions batched from the ActionInterface are dispatched.
